## PLANT EVOLUTION SIMULATION
The simulation shows a population of plants (roughly based on plants in the mustard family).
The lifecycle is shown, from germination to growth of leaves, buds, flowers, and seedpods.
The seedpods eventually drop their seeds, the old plants whither away, and a new population grows.
Users can select which plants the seeds for the new generation will be from.
This will model the process of evolution of the population by artificial selection (selective breeding).
If users do not make selections, the population will anyway evolve through natural selection.
The time can be speeded up with a time slider.
If the time slider is set on zero, day/night is shown;
or:
Various events will be simulated in which certain plants will be destroyed, 
leaving other plants to produce seeds for the next generation:
A storm with a flood that washes away some plants
A bulldozer comes and destroys some plants
## TODO
  - [ ] Make flood and bulldozer happen at random times when timer is at zero
  - [ ] Make seeds fall after withering, just before new season starts (not when selected)
  - [ ] Make plants fall over after seeds drop
  - [ ] ROOTS: adjust the root width selection and drawing
  - [ ] Make multiple bolts of lightning during the flood
  - [ ] For broccoli and cauliflower, pause before growing stalk with seedpods
  - [ ] Check speed
